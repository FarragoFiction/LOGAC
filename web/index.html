TODO:
<li>get alchemyResult into LOGAC ignoring all useless shit</li>
<li>* concept of "item" (which can be invisibly owned by team)</li>
<li>* concept of "rule" (which can be either valid (form in alchemy sim) or invalid (function in alchemy sim))</li>
<li>* test rule alchemy. REDO AND so that it picks every other trait (starting with first item) so it doesn't go over max
    8 traits.</li>
<li>owl animation test (from lomat) confirm random jerseys</li>
<li>*generate system to slurp trait data from json files. 80 max, their id is their index in the json</li>
<li>* generate system to slurp item data from json files , item has 8 rule ids, a name, and an image.</li>
<link>* have a few test items/traits, confirm them can be loaded</link>
<li>when displaying traits, replace "OBJECT" with a level dependant string</li>
<li>* system to generate a procedural seeded puzzle (OR a sports object with a random object, then the same but backwards
    to get two teams, then AND each with a random object)</li>
<li>* test page that lets you pick items from drop down, try to alchemize a solution to puzzle. is it fun?</li>
<li>* actually start wiring up real system, with items in a pile on the ground.drag item up to add it to left or right
    traits screen. if in screen, not on ground. otherwise items not used up.</li>
